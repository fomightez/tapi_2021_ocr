## Description

*A 2021 [Text Analysis Pedagogy Institute](http://labs.jstor.org/tapi/) course.*

Instructor: Hannah Jacobs

This course will introduce the concept of “Optical Character Recognition” (OCR), various tools available for performing OCR, and important considerations for successfully OCRing digitized text. Using Tesseract in Python, we’ll walk through the entire process using a variety of examples to show the range of challenges scholars can face when performing OCR. By the end of the course, participants should be able to use the course’s Jupyter Notebooks to perform OCR on their own; they should be able to identify possible technical challenges presented by specific texts and propose potential solutions; and they should be able to assess the degree of accuracy they have achieved in performing OCR.

## Land Acknowledgment

These materials were prepared and are presented on the ancestral homelands of the Haliwa-Saponi, Sappony, and Occaneechi Band of the Saponi nations, whose lands are now known as Durham, North Carolina. This acknowledgement reminds us of the significance of place even in a virtual space, and of our ongoing need to build a more inclusive and equitable society.

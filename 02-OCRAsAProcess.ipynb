    "#### 1. How much text?\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with this question because if you have only a few pages, there may be merit in typing them out by hand in a text editor, and perhaps working with a team to do so. If you have hundreds of thousands of pages, though, it may take far longer than you have time, even working with a team, to manually transcribe every page you need to complete a project. That may mean that you'll want to start with an automated transcription (OCR) process and then work to correct what the computer outputs. *There are caveats to this method--read on.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Is the text born-digital or digitized from paper or another analog physical medium?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Born-digital texts in PDF and image formats can be easier for a computer to \"read\" than are scanned documents,* even if the scanners use the highest resolution equipment. This is particularly true of older printed texts for reasons that we'll learn more about below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*An exception to this is if a born-digital text is stored in an image or other non-text-editable format that is uncommon, proprietary, or outdated.* Then computers may have a hard time accessing the file in order to parse the text contained. (So always save documents in an interoperable--can be opened by different software programs--file format either as [editable text](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance-tables.html#textualdata) or as [non-editable image or archival document--PDF--formats](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance-tables.html#scannedtext).)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Is the text written by hand or printed using a press?\n",
    "\n",
    "OCR technologies were *initially developed to deal only with digitized texts created using a [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press)*. This was because printing presses offer a certain amount of consistency in typeface, font, and layout that programmers could use to create rules for computers to follow (algorithms!). Meanwhile, handwriting is, by and large, more individualistic and inconsistent. Most programs for OCR still focus only on printed texts, but *there are a growing number of projects and toolkits now available for what's called variously [\"digital paleography\"](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/32/suppl_2/ii89/4259068), [\"handwriting recognition\" (HWR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition), and [\"handwritten text recognition\" (HTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition).*\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's compare excerpts from Toni Morrison's *Beloved*. The first image below is a page from an early draft, written in Morrison's own hand on a legal pad. The second image is a segment from a digitized print version. These are not the same passages, but they are noticably different in how we read them: Try reading each. What's different about the experience--think about order of reading, ease of reading, and any other differences that come to mind:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. How is the text formatted on the page?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Look at the texts above again: How are they formatted similarly or differently?* While both use a left-to-right writing system, the printed version appears in a single column that is evenly spaced both horizontally and vertically. The manuscript text appears on lined paper in a single column, but it includes a number of corrections written between lines or even in different directions (vertically) on the page. You might have tilted your head to read some of that text--if you had been holding the paper in your hands, you might have turned the paper 90 degrees. But computers don't necessarily know to do that (yet). They need a predictable pattern to follow, which the printed text provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, not all historical printings are as regular as this *Beloved* excerpt. Let's take a look at one more example from *On The Books*:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/07-ocr-04.jpeg\" width=\"70%\" style=\"padding-top:20px; box-shadow: 25px 25px 20px -30px rgba(0, 0, 0);\" alt=\"Screenshot from the 1887 North Carolina session laws digitized by UNC Libraries and shared via the Internet Archive.\" title=\"Screenshot from the 1887 North Carolina session laws digitized by UNC Libraries and shared via the Internet Archive.\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the printed *Beloved* example, this selection from the [1887 North Carolina session laws](https://archive.org/details/lawsresolutionso1887nort/page/776/mode/2up) was created using a printing press and with mostly even vertical spacing between lines that run left to right. However, in addition to the changing typeface, there is in addition to the main column of text a much smaller column of annotations--[\"marginalia\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia)--created to aid readers who would have been looking for quick topical references rather than reading a volume from start to finish. These created a problem for the *On The Books* team because the computer read them as being part of the main text. What resulted (with other OCR errors removed) would have looked like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SECTION 1. The Julian S. Carr, of Durham, North Carolina, Mar- Body politic. cellus E. McDowell, Samuel H. Austin, Jr., and John A. McDowell,`\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the problem here? The marginalia, `Body politic`, have been interspersed with the text as the computer \"reads\" all the way across the page. The line should read:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SECTION 1. The Julian S. Carr, of Durham, North Carolina, Mar-cellus E. McDowell, Samuel H. Austin, Jr., and John A. McDowell,`\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer doesn't realize that it's creating errors, and if the annotations are not in any way mispelled, the *On The Books* team might have a hard time finding and removing all of these insertions. The insertions might then have also caused major difficulties in future computational analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because marginalia would have caused such havoc in their dataset, the *On The Books* team decided to remove the marginalia as part of preparing for OCR. You can [find the documentation about this in the team's Github](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/OnTheBooks/tree/master/examples/marginalia_determination).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Is the digitized text showing signs of damage, such as fading, spills, smears, or paper disintigration or tearing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the use of state of the art scanning equipment ([for example](https://www.digitalnc.org/about/what-we-use-to-digitize-materials/)), annotations on or damage to analog physical media can interfere with OCR. Here are some examples.\n",

    "#### 6. Is the text using a historical script such as [Carolingian miniscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies mainly to students and scholars working with *historical texts printed or written in scripts that are not commonly legible to humans (or computers) today*. These could be anything from medieval scripts like Carolingian miniscule to neogothic scripts used in [twentieth-century German-American newspapers](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84027107/1915-07-01/ed-1/seq-1/) to the many, many historic non-Western scripts. These are areas where research is in progress, but you might find this [Manuscript OCR](https://manuscriptocr.org/) tool of interest as well as this [essay on the challenges medievalists continue to face when using OCR technologies](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/1/000412/000412.html). When choosing an OCR tool, this is one of the capabilities you'll want to check for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Is the text in a human language that computers can \"read\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the historic script issue, for scholars and students working with or studying *less common, perhaps endangered, and especially non-Western languages*, you'll want to see if an OCR tool supports your particular language. Tesseract offers [a list of the languages and scripts it supports](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html). Tesseract supports 125 languages and dialects--likely those most commonly spoken, based on shared [writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system), and/or those that researchers may have invested time in training Tesseract to \"read\" for some specific reason. This is just a fraction of the languages and scripts in the world, though. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, if you're working with Indigenous writing systems such as [Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics), you still may need to seek out additional support from computer scientists for developing OCR technologies to \"read\" these languages. This lack of support for many endangered languages is just one example of bias found in the broader technology industry.\n",

This is because scanned session law volumes often include other content, such as a scan of the outer covers, a table of contents, and the North Carolina state constitution, appearing before or after the laws themselves. Because the *On The Books Team* is only interested in the laws themselves, we went through each volume and removed all images that we did't need. The lesson here: **don't run OCR on content that you don't need.** \n",

Use caution if you choose this route, though, as it can be hard to undo deletions performed programmatically.

If you *don't* find pages like these out of order in your own corpus, either indicated by page numbers in the images themselves or by numbered file names skipping an integer, *it may not be worth your time to check every page* (particularly if you are dealing with thousands of pages).

    "Depending on the *complexity* of your corpus, you may want to select a few different samples to complete this process with and then compare the adjustments you make across all samples to see which adjustments work best overall, and which might *introduce* errors to certain parts of the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "If need be, you could consider running OCR on separate parts of your corpus. The *On The Books* team did this because marginalia (text printed in the margins) appear through a significant portion of the corpus but are no longer printed after a certain point.

    "While the above looks promising--and we could go ahead and create a loop to run this code on every image file in the 1955 volume--we always run the risk of introducing errors into our plain text output that can be avoided by some pre-processing steps. So let's pause on the OCR for a bit and look at some of the steps you might need to take into consideration with your own materials. Although Tesseract does an overall good job addressing these issues when they are minor, it may be worth your while to fix any issues you notice *before* running Tesseract to avoid introducing errors into OCR'ed text in the first place:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rescaling\n",
    "**The higher quality the digitization, the better the OCR**--this is the general rule. \"Quality\" has a lot to do with the OCR requirements we've already covered as well as those we'll cover below. We can begin, though, with the number of pixels per image--that is, the number of pixels per *inch*. Remember that computers present images as a grid of pixels, usually squares but sometimes rectangles, and that each carry specific color information. Put hundreds, thousands, millions of pixels together, and we have an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/07-ocr-01.jpeg\" width=\"70%\" style=\"padding-top:20px; box-shadow: 25px 25px 20px -30px rgba(0, 0, 0);\" alt=\"Screenshot of text stored in an image format from a page of North Carolina laws\" title=\"Screenshot of text stored in an image format from a page of North Carolina laws\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way for computer programmers to measure image quality is by assessing the number of pixels per inch (ppi). This is important for many reasons: a photographer will want to keep their number of pixels high (perhaps 300 ppi) in preparation for printing, but a web designer will want a much lower number of pixels (72 ppi) to keep an image looking crisp while also keeping file sizes small to avoid slowing down webpage loading time. If you've ever opened a webpage and seen text but had to wait a few seconds for images to load, you've seen the difference between how long it takes for text vs. an image to load. The more pixels, the larger the file (in kilobytes, megabytes, or even gigabytes), and large files take longer to move from a server to your computer--add in low bandwidth internet, and the load time increases exponentially. \n",

    "\n",
    "The image on the right is the same letter S rescaled to 300 ppi. The squares here appear smaller because there are far more of them. Note that instead of there being only a line 1-2 pixels wide making up the S shape, there are far more--far more for Tesseract to \"read\" and interpret.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "    <p><a href=\"https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality\" target=\"blank\">Per its documentation</a>, Tesseract works best with an image resolution of 300 ppi. The documentation actually uses \"dpi\", or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch\" target=\"blank\">\"dots per inch\"</a>. If you're beginning your project by scanning materials, this unit will be important when you set up your scanner, but once you move into image processing, we're dealing with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density\" target=\"blank\">pixels per inch</a>. These are not the same, but many people use dpi and ppi interchangeably.</p>\n",

    "The images we downloaded from the Internet Archive are 72ppi--optimized for web viewing. In an ideal world, we'd go back and use the .jp2 files, which are higher resolution. While it's possible to rescale (increase the ppi) of our sample images, increasing ppi involves using algorithms that can change, in minute ways, an image file. Those minute changes could make a larger impact on OCR results depending on the original image. For this reason, **it's always better to start by creating high resolution image files in the scanning process.** For our purposes here, PyTesseract has already proven that it's working well with the .jpg 72 ppi versions of the Internet Archive files. If you're interested in learning more about rescaling images, though, try this [GeeksForGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-resize-method/) or these [Photoshop instructions](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/resizing-image.html) as a starting point.\n",

It will still attempt to read a rotated line from left to right--it won't know to follow the text as it slants down or up.

    "The result ([again saved with this Notebook](sessionlawsresol1955nort_0057_grayscale.jpg)) in our case is less exciting because our image already had dark ink on a light background. Nonetheless, it helps us see more clearly where there might be variations in background color that will interfere with OCR. In this case, a smudge in the top right corner, far from the text, has become much more visible, as has the shadow near the gutter (where the page meets the volume's binding). Gutter shadows can cause problems if there is little margin between the gutter and page text. Tesseract has an [example of a page](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality#binarisation) that demonstrates much more dramatically how binarization can reveal shadows on a page.\n",

    "Finally, there is dilation and erosion. As we can see in our sample page, printers often varied font thickness when they set the text type. Bold might be used for headings while thinner fonts might be used for smaller text. Depending on the print quality, bolded text might have additional ink around it, while thinner text might not have enough ink. Variation in ink thickness can throw Tesseract off, so **eroding bolded text** (making it thinner) and **dilating very thin text** (adding thickness) can help address this issue.\n",

We won't cover it here (and our samples don't need it!), but [this GeeksForGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/erosion-dilation-images-using-opencv-python/) explains the basics and provides sample code."

As with pre-processing, how complex you make iterations in this phase depends on your corpus and your resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the OCR output.** Take an initial look at the OCR text files. Sometimes even just a glance will give you a sense of how well the process has gone. If you see a lot of errors, return to the [pre-processing](#pre-processing) questions and consider which steps you might take to improve the OCR output.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Python to check for and correct possible recurring & unique spelling errors.** These are errors that appear frequently and may be caused by the typescript, hyphenation at the end of lines, or other patterns that Tesseract repeatedly misinterprets. This step should focus on common words and avoid proper nouns (unless you have a full list of proper nouns to draw from). As with any automated step, it's possible that new errors will be introduced here. If there is a known and small quantity of proper nouns used in individual texts or across the corpus, and these are consistently \"read\" incorrectly by Tesseract, it may be possible to use Python to correct these.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If your corpus is small enough and/or you have a team that can help you, **read through the corpus to manually check for and correct unique errors**. This may be a moment to correct proper nouns. If you have a team, it may be advisable to have texts read and corrected by multiple team members. It will be important that these team members have access to both inputs and outputs, and perhaps even lists of proper nouns, to be able to compare the original scans with the computer-readable versions. You may even want to set up a process whereby reviewers can flag words they are not sure about so that another reviewer can provide their opinion so that you and/or another project manager making a final decision on uncertain words.\n",

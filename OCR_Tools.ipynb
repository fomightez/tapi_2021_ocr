    "If you have [Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/) on your computer, then you have probably already been using software that contains OCR functionality. Acrobat's OCR is designed to help users [edit scanned PDFs or PDFs created by others](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/edit-scanned-pdfs.html). It can also be used to export editable text versions (e.g. Microsoft Word documents), or to ask the computer to read aloud the text contained in the PDF. However, *at scale* and working with *older printed documents, perhaps with irregular printing patterns*, Acrobat may not be your best bet. Especially if you don't have a *license* for it. (Note: UNC staff & faculty can access Adobe Acrobat Pro, which has these functionalities. UNC students have access only to Acrobat Reader for viewing PDFs. Check the [software list here](https://software.sites.unc.edu/shareware/#a).)"

    "### Is the tool proprietary or open source?\n",
    "\n",
    "Proprietary, meaning do you need to purchase a license? Knowing the resources you have or need to start your OCR project is key to how you make your decision. You may wish to work with a program such as [ABBYY FineReader](https://pdf.abbyy.com/pricing/), which includes a number of graphical features for preprocessing (read on) that you'd like to use. But you'll need to be prepared to pay $200-300 for it. If you don't have those funds, you may wish to work with a free tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although *free* software is not necessarily the same as *open source* software, [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) software is free. **Open source, in the software world, refers to software whose creators have made the underlying code available for others to edit and build upon.** You may opt to choose an open source OCR tool as a form of [algorithmic resistance](01-AlgorithmsOfResistance-WhatIsAnAlgorithm.ipynb#resistance), and/or you may choose open source so that you have more access to the codebase, and therefore better understanding of the computation that goes into performing OCR on your corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does it include a GUI (graphical user interface), or is it run in a script?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working on a project alone with no coding experience, you may be thinking that a GUI that provides the ease of clicking a button is the best way to go--and it may be if you have very limited time. On the other hand, you may wish to learn some coding. If so, learning how to run OCR with Python is a great opportunity. Even if you're collaborating with a programmer who will write most of your OCR code, you may want to learn some of the concepts and basic steps behind the OCR to ensure you have a good understanding of this project phase and to aid communications with your collaborator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kinds of file types can it process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the OCR tool work only with PDFs, or can it also read image files? Which file type(s) are you working with? This may seem a small point, but if you have image files, and you purchase a license for OCR software that works only with PDFs, you may be a bit surprised. There are tools out there that can help you convert images to PDFs, but you may risk degrading the scanned text with these conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Which languages can it handle?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with texts that are not in English, it's a good idea to check--remember our discussion above about Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics? At this point, most OCR tools work with multiple languages, and some work with many.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which [human] scripts can it read?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, remember our discussion of Carolingian miniscule? If you're working with a language written in a script no longer commonly in use, you may need to seek out some specific tools to assist you. Even if you're working with [late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century American non-English newspapers](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93060356/1917-01-18/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1880&index=11&date2=1917&searchType=advanced&language=&sequence=0&words=son+sonille&proxdistance=5&state=Missouri&rows=20&ortext=son&proxtext=&phrasetext=&andtext=&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1), you may need to find out which tools handle specific scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does it come with any kind of preprocessing features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember all of the [considerations for making a text computer readable](#making-readable)? **Preprocessing is a set of steps that we can use to try to minimize issues such as a skewed page, faded text, or smudges on a page *before* performing OCR.** Some OCR tools offer some preprocessing tools. Other's don't. Even if a tool can run preprocessing, though, you may find you have a specific need that must be met with another tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does it provide information and tools for assessing errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can it help you see evaluate how well the process has gone and where there may be errors to correct? Are there tools to support both automated and manual error correction? How will you know if the OCRed corpus you've produced is of a high enough quality?"

    "## An Overview of OCR Tools\n",

    "*This list is not comprehensive!*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [ABBYY Fine Reader](https://pdf.abbyy.com/)\n",
    "Perhaps at the opposite end of the OCR spectrum from Pytesseract, ABBYY is another powerful OCR tool. It has a GUI (graphical user interface) in which users can make adjustments (preprocessing), and it also has an SDK (software developer toolkit) that programmers can use to run ABBYY tools in their own programs. ABBYY even has a cloud service. Like Tesseract, ABBYY supports many languages and a number of file formats. ABBYY is, however, proprietary--you'll need to be prepared to pay a minimum of $200 if your institution does not provide a license.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html)\n",
    "A common PDF reader, Acrobat can do a lot of things including OCR. It comes in DC and Pro DC versions, and both are paid. DC includes OCR functionality in the \"Enhance PDF\" menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/resources/?blog-posts-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-posts-cards.sort-order=desc)\n",
    "Like Pytesseract, this tool from Amazon runs in Python. Like ABBYY Fine Reader, it's proprietary code, which means we don't know what's happening in Textract itself when we use it--it's a black box. There is a free tier to get started if you're working with fewer than 1,000 pages, and you can run your Textract code in Amazon's cloud environment. The cost to use it, if you are planning to learn a little programming or are working with a programmer, is significantly lower than the cost of an ABBYY license.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs)\n",
    "A competitor of Amazon's, Google's Cloud Vision API (application programming interface) is likewise proprietary after a certain number of uses, requires programming knowledge, and can be used in the cloud. This same tool can be used to perform computer vision tasks such as facial recognition. Because we don't know what's happening in Cloud Vision's code when we use it, we might not be able to explain unexpected results--it's another [black box](01-AlgorithmsOfResistance-WhatIsAnAlgorithm.ipynb#algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html)\n",
    "An OCR engine (basically, a collection of algorithms and training data) originally developed by Hewlett Packard and maintained by Google. Tesseract is open source and supports many languages and scripts. It also offers possibilities to customize OCR outputs in ways that may or may not be possible with proprietary software. The ability to add your own training data is also a big feature, though a resource-intensive process. Programmers have taken advantage of Tesseract being open source and have created [a number of tools based on Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty) (some with GUIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)\n",
    "Pytesseract (or Python-tesseract) is a powerful OCR tool made for the programming language Python using the Tesseract OCR Engine. It can work with many file formats and (human) languages, and, like [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), is open source. Since Pytesseract is used in a larger programming ecosystem, it can be combined with a variety of other Python packages to perform many different tasks. Furthermore, Python is both highly used and a popular computer language for beginning programmers, making it possible for users to move quickly from the basics of Python into working with Pytesseract."

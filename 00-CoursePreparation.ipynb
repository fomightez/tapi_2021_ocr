    "### About this Course\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will introduce the concept of “Optical Character Recognition” (OCR), various tools available for performing OCR, and important considerations for successfully OCRing digitized text. Using Tesseract in Python, we’ll walk through the entire process using a variety of examples to show the range of challenges scholars can face when performing OCR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the course, participants should be able to \n",
    "\n",
    "- define \"OCR\";\n",
    "- explain the importance of OCR for computer-aided reading and analysis;\n",
    "- point to use cases for OCR in teaching & research.\n",
    "- use the course’s Jupyter Notebooks to perform OCR on their own; \n",
    "- identify possible technical challenges presented by specific texts and propose potential solutions; \n",
    "- assess the degree of accuracy they have achieved in performing OCR.\n",
